"Build a web application for an Intelligent Vehicle Classification and Security System designed to enhance law enforcement capabilities. The application should include:

Real-time License Plate Recognition (LPR):
Use YOLO and EasyOCR to detect and read vehicle license plates. Implement HSRP validation for fake or duplicate plate detection.

Facial Recognition:
Integrate DeepFace for recognizing wanted criminals, missing persons, or suspicious individuals using live CCTV feeds. Generate instant alerts if a match is found.

Accident Detection and Emergency Response:
Use AI-based models to detect accidents from CCTV footage or dashcam feeds. Send immediate emergency alerts and notify appropriate services.

Vehicle Theft Detection:
Automatically detect stolen vehicles based on a predefined database and send alerts to authorities.

Traffic Violation Monitoring:
Detect violations like speeding, red-light jumping, and other traffic rule infractions. Notify authorities in real-time.

Centralized Dashboard:
Build a secure, cloud-based dashboard for law enforcement that integrates all the system features in one place. Provide live feeds, incident alerts, and vehicle/person reports.

Google Maps Integration:
Enable a map view to visualize crime-prone areas, historical vehicle crime data, and real-time locations of incidents.

User Authentication and Role-Based Access:
Implement a secure login system with role-based access (e.g., police, traffic control, admin) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js for the user interface

Backend: FastAPI/Django REST for fast and efficient API processing

Database: PostgreSQL/Firebase for storing and managing data securely

AI Models: YOLO for object detection (LPR, Accident Detection), DeepFace for facial recognition

Cloud Hosting: AWS / Google Cloud for scalable, secure hosting

The application must be optimized for a web environment, focusing on efficiency, security, and user experience. Implement a minimal camera setup for demonstration, where one camera can handle all tasks (LPR, facial recognition, accident detection)."
